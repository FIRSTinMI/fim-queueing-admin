Hello!
Thank you for volunteering with FIRST in Michigan as AV. Here is the information you’ll need to get the queueing display set up for {EVENTNAME}.
- Event key: `{KEY}` (Note: Please do not share your event key.)
- Queueing display link: https://fim-queueing.web.app

Your key will become active at midnight Eastern Time on the morning of {DATE}. You can open the queueing display at any time, and it will start showing data shortly after qualification schedules are generated. Any internet connection will work for the queueing display, even if it’s not the same network as the AV computer.

If you have two TVs available at your venue, put the queueing display up on one of them, and the pit display up on the other. If you only have one TV available, you can either a) put this queueing display up in fullscreen with the rankings checkbox enabled or b) put the queueing display on one half of the screen and the pit display on the other half.

If you have any issues with the queueing display, feel free to reach out to me here on Slack! For any other AV issues, you’re probably best off using #av-help and I or one of the other volunteers can answer.
