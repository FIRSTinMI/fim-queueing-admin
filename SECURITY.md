# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest commit in the `main` branch is supported, as Continuous Delivery results in the production environment always using that
commit's code.

If you come across any exploitable security issues in this project, please send an email to security-fim\[at\]evandoes\[dot\]dev.
Any reports are greatly appreciated and efforts will be made to get it patched as soon as possible if it poses a risk to data integrity
or infrastructure.
